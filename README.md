## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy orjson python-dateutil rich
```

### Rest Weeks

Add a week to your plan with `"drill": "Rest"` to skip training and recover extra
fatigue and stress. The simulator applies an additional **-20 fatigue** and
**-10 stress** on top of normal weekly recovery when it encounters a Rest entry.

### Praise & Scold Events

In-game, you can only praise or scold a monster when a drill result is **Great**, **Fail**, or the monster **Cheats**.
The simulator now rolls these outcomes each week, so loyalty gains from praise or scold are **not** guaranteed.
